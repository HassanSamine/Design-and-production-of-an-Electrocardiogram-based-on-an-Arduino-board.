# Overview

I embarked on a tremendous journey for my final project in BTS Al-Khaouarizmi university, where I designed and created an Electrocardiogram (ECG) system utilizing an Arduino board. I was fortunate to have a brilliant professor who offered me indispensable guidance, contributing to my immense growth and understanding. Through our collaboration, we successfully integrated various electronic components to capture and analyze heart signals, resulting in real-time ECG readings.
